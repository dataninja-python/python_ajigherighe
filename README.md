# python_ajigherighe

My desire is to expand my skills by turning the process of submitting homework into python program built using
a modular architecture. The user (Reviewer) should be able to run the main 'run.py' file to select a homework 
section and continue drilling down to the specific homework desired.

Of course, a reviewer can always look at the code in each homework directly or test an individual homework. However,
because some assignments call on middleware, I ask that the entire folder be entered as a PyCharm project.
