Student: Akpo "AJ" Igherighe
Section/Level: 1

Completing the initial exercises took more time because I want to push myself to get better at designing and creating
more comprehensive python programs vs simple scripts.

Thus, each exercise is architected to run as a standalone script but also to be an importable module. This allows me
to build a program in a modular manner where each exercise is an executable script, each unit imports exercises into
an executable script for use by the reviewer, each section imports its units into an executable run script, and 
finally as I near completion of homework assignments a master 'run.py' file will be finished that imports each 
section's run files and allows the reviewer to access all of them by executing this one file.

Of course, a reviewer can always look at the code in each homework directly or test an individual homework. However,
because many assignments call on middleware (right now, these are the 'constants' and 'helpers' files contained
in each section), please open the entire 'python_ajigherighe' folder as a PyCharm project. This is my attempt to 
follow the DRY principle. However, if it is bothersome or problematic, let me know and I will refactor the code.

This README file covers Level 1 Exercises. Requirements are listed below:
